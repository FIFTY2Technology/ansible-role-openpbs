#   * Defaults can be ignored by setting the "use" variable to 'false'
#   * Both lists ('default' and 'custom') are merged into one list
#   * Custom includes can be set e.g. in host_vars or group_vars
#   * Setting the "use" variable to 'false' and leaving the custom variables
#     empty will result in an empty file
# The same applies to excludes below.
